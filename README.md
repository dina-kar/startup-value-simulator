# Fund Sim - A Startup Value Simulator

A modern web application for modeling startup cap tables across funding rounds and calculating exit value distribution.

## 🧩 Overview
Plan, visualize, and share multi‑round dilution scenarios (founders, SAFEs, priced rounds, ESOP adjustments, secondary sales preview) with instant recalculation, mobile‑friendly UI, and an auditable calculation trail.

---
## ⚡ Quick Start
```bash
pnpm install            # Install dependencies
cp env.example .env.local  # Add Supabase project keys
pnpm setup:profile-db   # (Optional) Run DB bootstrap script
pnpm dev                # Start local dev server (http://localhost:3000)
```

Minimal required env vars (see `.env.example`):
```
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=...
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=...
```

---
## 🔧 Local Setup (Detailed)
1. Install PNPM if missing: `npm i -g pnpm`
2. Create a Supabase project, grab URL + anon key.
3. Copy env file: `cp .env.example .env.local` and fill values.
4. Initialize database (either):
   - Automated: `pnpm setup:profile-db`
   - Manual: run `database/setup.sql` in Supabase SQL editor.
5. Start dev server: `pnpm dev` (hot reload enabled).
6. (Optional) Run tests: `pnpm test` (Vitest config present for financial engine).

Project scripts of interest:
| Script | Purpose |
| ------ | ------- |
| `pnpm dev` | Start Next.js (App Router) dev server |
| `pnpm build` | Production build |
| `pnpm lint` | Biome lint/format (see `biome.json`) |
| `pnpm test` | Vitest suite (financial calculations) |
| `pnpm setup:profile-db` | Convenience DB bootstrap script |

## 🏗️ Architecture (Updated)

Core layers:
1. UI Layer (Next.js App Router + shadcn/ui) – pages under `src/app/*` orchestrate feature shells.
2. State Layer (Zustand) – scenario data, UI state (notifications, sidebar, modals), user preferences (currency) stored in lightweight stores for predictable ephemeral state.
3. Financial Engine – pure TypeScript class (`CalculationEngine.ts`) transforming scenario input -> derived cap table, per‑round results, exit distribution.
4. Persistence Layer – Supabase (scenarios, shared links, user profiles) with RLS; thin query wrappers add typing & error normalization.
5. Presentation Components – split by domain (`charts/`, `rounds/`, `results/`, `modals/`, `layout/`). Mobile adaptations (popover tab selectors) unify experience across small screens.
6. Utility Layer – formatting (currency, numbers), guards, auto‑save, notification helpers.

Key runtime flows:
| Flow | Steps |
| ---- | ----- |
| Scenario Edit | User edits setup/round -> Zustand update -> Recompute via engine -> UI charts + tables re-render (derived state only) |
| Auto Save | Debounced change detection -> validate -> Supabase upsert (skips empty scenario) -> save status indicator |
| Share Link | Generate token row -> build public URL `/share/[token]` -> consumer loads read‑only snapshot |
| Audit Trail | User opens drawer -> existing computed `calculations` object rendered with contextual formulas |

Performance considerations:
- Pure calculation engine (no side effects) enables cheap recomputation.
- Stable component boundaries reduce unnecessary renders.
- Mobile tab popovers collapse horizontal overflow.
- Deferred modals/drawers mount only when opened.

State stores (primary):
| Store | Responsibility |
| ----- | -------------- |
| `scenarioStore` | Scenario entity, founders, rounds, ESOP, calculations, validation |
| `uiStore` | Notifications, modals, active tabs, sidebar collapsed state, loading indicators |
| `preferencesStore` (if present) | User-local settings (currency, etc.) |

Directory highlights (delta since earlier phases):
- `components/layout/ScenarioTabs.tsx` & `components/results/ResultsView.tsx`: responsive popover + tab pattern with transition classes.
- `components/modals/AuditDrawer.tsx`: now mobile-aware with popover tab selector.
- Sidebar collapse state persisted via `uiStore` (navigation no longer forces reopen).

## 💰 Financial Model Assumptions & Limitations

Baseline Share Model:
- Fixed initial fully diluted base: 10,000,000 shares (improves fractional precision, configurable in future).
- Founder shares allocated proportionally to declared initial equity; ESOP carved out separately.
- ESOP initial pool percentage reduces available founder equity (guard: founders + ESOP ≤ 100%).

Round Ordering & Processing:
- Rounds sorted by `order` field before computation.
- SAFE rounds accumulate (no immediate share issuance) until first priced round triggers conversion.
- Priced round with pending SAFEs: all prior unconverted SAFEs convert concurrently at the better (lower) of cap price vs discounted price (standard best‑of terms). MFN placeholder (logic extensible).

SAFE Conversion Details:
- Cap price = valuation cap ÷ pre‑conversion share count.
- Discount price = priced round share price × (1 - discount%).
- Conversion price = min(cap price, discount price). Shares = investment ÷ conversion price.

ESOP Handling:
- Pre‑money expansion: increases pre‑money share count so ESOP equals target % of (pre‑investment) shares, diluting only existing holders.
- Post‑money expansion: after new investment shares are added, expands pool so ESOP equals target % of final total (dilutes all holders pro‑rata).
- ESOP tracked as a single stakeholder (future: split granted vs available, vesting, refresh logic).

Dilution & Ownership:
- Dilution per round = new shares issued / post‑round total shares.
- Ownership breakdown recalculated each round from updated totals (founders, ESOP, “round investor”, plus SAFE conversions folded into priced round investor currently – future: multiple investor entities).

Exit Distribution:
- Pure pro‑rata (percentage based) – no liquidation preferences, participation, stacking, or conversion waterfalls modeled yet.
- Net value = ownership % × exit value input (single static exit scenario; future: distribution curves / sensitivities).

Secondary Transactions:
- Basic founder share sales supported (reduces founder shares, increases round investor shares) – does not change total share count.

Validation Rules:
- Positive amounts / valuations / caps required; ESOP 0–50%; founder equity > 0 and aggregate within allowable post‑ESOP range.

Not Yet Modeled (Intentional Simplifications):
- Liquidation preferences (1x, participating, capped).
- Option exercise timing / dilution impacts at exit.
- Multiple distinct investor entities per round.
- Convertible notes vs SAFEs distinctions.
- Anti‑dilution adjustments (weighted average / full ratchet).
- Vesting schedules & unvested share clawbacks.
- Tax treatments or transaction fees.
- Complex secondary market structures / tender offer mechanics.

Planned Extensibility Points:
- Plug‑in preference waterfall engine.
- Multi‑exit scenario comparison (sensitivity analysis array).
- Investor registry & instrument metadata (preferred, common, SAFE, note).
- Advanced ESOP forecasting (refresh cadence, burn modeling).

Disclaimer: Model outcomes are illustrative only and omit important legal & economic nuances. Always consult professional advisors for real transactions.

## 🔧 **Environment Setup**

Create a `.env.local` file with your Supabase credentials:

```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_project_url
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key
```

See `.env.example` for the complete template.

## 🗄️ **Database Setup**

The application requires a Supabase database with the following tables:

1. **Run the database setup script**:
   ```bash
   pnpm setup:profile-db
   ```

2. **Or manually execute the SQL**:
   - Copy the contents of `database/setup.sql`
   - Paste into your Supabase SQL editor
   - Execute to create tables and RLS policies

3. **Tables created**:
   - `user_profiles` - User profile data and settings
   - `scenarios` - Cap table scenarios
   - `shared_scenarios` - Scenario sharing and access control

All tables include Row Level Security (RLS) policies to ensure users can only access their own data.

## 🚀 **Next Steps**

The application is now feature-complete and production-ready. Potential future enhancements could include:

- **User Authentication** - Add user accounts and multi-user support
- **Advanced Analytics** - Scenario comparison and trend analysis
- **Team Collaboration** - Multi-user editing and comments
- **Export Features** - PDF reports and data export
- **API Integration** - Connect with external cap table services

The foundation is solid and extensible for any future development needs.
